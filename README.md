# Simple-Orbit-Example

This program is designed more for demonstrational use, and uses Euler's method to calculate the approximate next postion of the orbiting satellite around a given planet. It will, however, accumulate error in the calculations, and even initially stable orbits will eventually destabilize. While the program is running, you can click anywhere on the screen to create a satellite, that will begin to move around the planet. It is possible that I will go back and create a more accurate way of calculating orbits, but it will most likely require differential calculus.
